// Browser based game. Obstacle run type game.

// Create basic html

// Game window contained within a div

// objects in the game will be html elements I suppose

// Gonna need a position variable for the character

// program movements to occur on keypresses, key presses manipulate position variables

// appearance of floor moving can be achieved in an animated way, swapping out imgs

// change image file on keypresses to animate character

// limit the variables so that you can't clip through the floor

// At semi random intervals render an enemy/obstacle on the right side of screen

// floor will be animated via cycling of images to depict movement

// Got to get assets. Can use free ones for now and swap out for Alfies at a later date

// animation should all be set at same framerate
